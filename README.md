# dwdbulk: Easy Access to the World of Open German Weather Data

## What is it?

**dwdbulk** is a library that enables users to access open German weather data provided by the Deutsche Wetterdienst (DWD). It aspires to acheive the following objectives:

- **Comprehensive:** Covers all relevant data made available by DWD.
- **Accessible:** With minimal code and similar interfaces, users can access full longitudinal span for weather stations, both for forecasts and historical observations; similarly users can easily access cross-sectional data for a Germany-wide view.
- **Consistent:** Data fields across different time frames and datasets are aligned (e.g. latitude and longitude always in decimal format).
- **Python 3.7+ & Pandas:** Uses 'modern' Python. Does not aspire to have a CLI or other interfaces. Is not backed by a database. Yields data in DataFrame format.
- **Lightweight:** Minimal dependencies.
- **Linux:** Given prevalence of containers and the potential maintenance overhead of Mac & Windows, only Linux is targeted for support.
